# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

In the root directory of the repository, run:

```sh
bun install
```

## Local Development

```sh
bun start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```sh
bun run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Docs are deployed to https://react-native-vision-camera.com using Next.js/Vercel.
